Hey!
This is my forum-themed project made for learning purposes at Copenhagen School of Design and Technology - KEA. 
The focus of it is on dynamic data, methods and other fun database related stuff.
This project was created during a very short time, therefore, it is not fully responsive, nor all features are working. 
For future improvements the project should have a dark theme, working voting system, possibility to create an account as well as customise the profile, save posts and share them conveniently.
